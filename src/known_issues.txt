It seems that Java does not play well with image files whose aspect ratio is very large. It will *load* such images,
but will throw a NullPointerException if you attempt to draw the image on a GraphicsContext. In the future, I'd like to
determine the aspect ratio limit and force this program to output a spritesheet whose ratio is acceptable to the JVM. In
the meantime, you can prevent an image from becoming too tall by adding a condition to the do-while loop of the pack()
method. There is a commented-out condition for convenience.
