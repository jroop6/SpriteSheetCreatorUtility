It seems that Java does not play well with image files whose aspect ratio is either very large or very small. It will
*load* such images, but will throw a NullPointerException if you attempt to draw the image on a GraphicsContext. In the
future, I'd like to determine the aspect ratio limit and force this program to output a sprite sheet whose ratio is
acceptable to the JVM. In the meantime, you can manually control the aspect ratio somewhat by setting upper and lower
bounds on the sprite sheet's height. The constants MAX_HEIGHT and MIN_HEIGHT are provided at the top of the
SpriteSheetCreatorUtility class for convenience.
